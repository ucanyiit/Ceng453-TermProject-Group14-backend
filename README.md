### How to run

The project hasn't been deployed to Heroku. Hence, in order to provide a server, we have to run the backend code the first, and then we are able to run the front end code without errors.

That is,
1. Install maven dependencies
2. Open the code in any IDE you would like to use
3. Choose target for the run config
4. Run the backend app
5. Run the frontend app
